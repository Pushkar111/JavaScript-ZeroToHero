
Synchronous JavaScript:
- Synchronous code is executed in a sequential manner, meaning one operation must complete before the next one starts.
- It is blocking, which means the execution of subsequent code is paused until the current operation completes.
- Example:
    console.log('Start');
    console.log('Middle');
    console.log('End');
    
        Output:
    
        Start
        Middle
        End
    
Asynchronous JavaScript:
- Asynchronous code allows multiple operations to run concurrently, without waiting for previous operations to complete.
- It is non-blocking, meaning the execution of subsequent code continues while the asynchronous operation is still in progress.
- Example using setTimeout:
    console.log('Start');
    setTimeout(() => {
        console.log('Middle');
    }, 1000);
    console.log('End');
    
        Output:
        Start
        End
        Middle
    
Key Differences:
1. Execution Order:
     - Synchronous: Sequential, one after another.
     - Asynchronous: Concurrent, can overlap in execution.

2. Blocking vs Non-blocking:
     - Synchronous: Blocking, waits for each operation to complete.
     - Asynchronous: Non-blocking, does not wait for operations to complete.

3. Use Cases:
     - Synchronous: Simple tasks, where blocking is acceptable.
     - Asynchronous: I/O operations, network requests, timers, where non-blocking is beneficial.
